Required:
==========

1) Dependencies as listed on http://community.kde.org/Plasma/Plasma_Media_Center/getting_started_with_PMC#Package_dependency

2) You need QxOrm 1.2.5 from http://www.qxorm.com/version/QxOrm_1.2.5.zip to build PMC.
Building QxOrm: After downloading it, simply run qmake && make debug-install.

If you get an error about missing libboost-serialization-mt, make sure you have the boost serialization libraries installed.
If you are sure the libraries are there, try running qmake like this-

qmake QX_BOOST_LIB_SERIALIZATION_DEBUG=boost_serialization

and then run make debug-install.

3) Standard KDE Oxygen Plasma theme

To know Plasma Media Center architecture and other related information browse through http://community.kde.org/Plasma/Plasma_Media_Center

Installation:
=========
Once you are done installing QxOrm, just do the usual cmake stuff-

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix`
make install
kbuildsycoca4

Run PMC using "plasma-mediacenter" or by using the "Plasma Media Center" icon in your launcher

Troubleshooting
===============

If you are having trouble playing audio and video files in latest Linux distributions, this is due to PMC is linking with both libplasma and QtMultimediaKit. libplasma links with libgstreamer1.0 while QtMultimediaKit links with libgstreamer0.10. If you are getting this problem. Please add option -DNO_LINK_TO_PLASMA to cmake as below,

cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` -DNO_LINK_TO_PLASMA

and then run make and make install.

(some of the old code can be found in the "old" branch, just in case somebody wants to browse)
