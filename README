Required:
==========

1) Dependencies as listed on http://community.kde.org/Plasma/Plasma_Media_Center/getting_started_with_PMC#Package_dependency

2) You need QxOrm 1.2.5 from http://www.qxorm.com/version/QxOrm_1.2.5.zip to build PMC.
Building QxOrm: After downloading it, simply run qmake && make debug-install.

If you get an error about missing libboost-serialization-mt, make sure you have the boost serialization libraries installed.
If you are sure the libraries are there, try running qmake like this-

qmake QX_BOOST_LIB_SERIALIZATION_DEBUG=boost_serialization

and then run make debug-install.

3) Standard KDE Oxygen Plasma theme

To know Plasma Media Center architecture and other related information browse through http://community.kde.org/Plasma/Plasma_Media_Center

Installation:
=========
Once you are done installing QxOrm, just do the usual cmake stuff-

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix`
make install
kbuildsycoca4

Run PMC using "plasma-mediacenter" or by using the "Plasma Media Center" icon in your launcher

(some of the old code can be found in the "old" branch, just in case somebody wants to browse)
