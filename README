Required:
==========

1) KDE Frameworks 5
2) KDE Plasma 5
3) Qt QtMultimedia
4) Baloo (KF5)
5) Taglib
6) Mockcpp (required for building tests)

To know Plasma Media Center architecture and other related information browse through http://community.kde.org/Plasma/Plasma_Media_Center

Installation:
=========
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DKDE_INSTALL_USE_QT_SYS_PATHS=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kf5-config --prefix` ..
make install
kbuildsycoca5

Run PMC using "plasmashell -ap org.kde.plasma.mediacenter" or by using the "Plasma Media Center" icon in your launcher

Uninstallation:
=============
Run this from build dir:
for i in $(cat install_manifest.txt); do sudo rm $i; done;


Troubleshooting
===============

1. If you find any error related to mockcpp and don't want to build test, pass -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF to cmake as below,
cmake -DKDE_INSTALL_USE_QT_SYS_PATHS=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kf5-config --prefix` -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF ..

and then run make and make install.

(some of the old code can be found in the "old" branch, just in case somebody wants to browse)
