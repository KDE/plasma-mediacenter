Required:
==========

1) Dependencies as listed on http://community.kde.org/Plasma/Plasma_Media_Center/getting_started_with_PMC#Package_dependency
2) You need ODB from http://codesynthesis.com/products/odb/ to build PMC. See README.odb for instructions
3) Standard KDE Oxygen Plasma theme

To know Plasma Media Center architecture and other related information browse through http://community.kde.org/Plasma/Plasma_Media_Center

Installation:
=========
Once you are done installing ODB, just do the usual cmake stuff-

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix`
make install
kbuildsycoca4

Run PMC using "plasma-mediacenter" or by using the "Plasma Media Center" icon in your launcher

(some of the old code can be found in the "old" branch, just in case somebody wants to browse)
