Required:
==========

1) Dependencies as listed on http://community.kde.org/Plasma/Plasma_Media_Center/getting_started_with_PMC#Package_dependency
2) Standard KDE Oxygen Plasma theme

To know Plasma Media Center architecture and other related information browse through http://community.kde.org/Plasma/Plasma_Media_Center

Installation:
=========
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix`
make install
kbuildsycoca4

Run PMC using "plasma-mediacenter" or by using the "Plasma Media Center" icon in your launcher

Troubleshooting
===============

1. If you are having trouble playing audio and video files in latest Linux distributions, this is due to PMC is linking with
both libplasma and QtMultimediaKit. libplasma links with libgstreamer1.0 while QtMultimediaKit links with libgstreamer0.10.
If you are getting this problem. Please add option -DNO_LINK_TO_PLASMA to cmake as below,

cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` -DNO_LINK_TO_PLASMA=ON

2. If you find any error related to mockcpp and don't want to build test, pass -DKDE4_BUILD_TESTS=OFF to cmake as below,
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` -DKDE4_BUILD_TESTS=OFF

and then run make and make install.

(some of the old code can be found in the "old" branch, just in case somebody wants to browse)
